# Dev Planner Project Rules

## Code Style
- NO comments in code - remove any existing comments when editing files
- Write clean, self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep code readable without comments - names should explain purpose
- Do not break existing logic when making changes

## Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Group related code together logically

## C++ Specific
- Use modern C++ (C++17) features
- Prefer Qt6 conventions
- Use nullptr instead of NULL
- Use auto where type is obvious
